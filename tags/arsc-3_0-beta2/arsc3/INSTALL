ARSC - ARSC Really Simple Chat - Installation instructions

ARSC can be installed by following these four steps:

- Create a MySQL database
- Provide the hostname, username, password, and database
  name to allow ARSC to connect to your MySQL Server
- Copy the ARSC files onto the webserver
- Open the install script url in the webbrowser

Let's look at these steps in detail:

First of all, you need a database on a MySQL server to which ARSC will
connect to once it is installed.

Create this database if you don't already have one that you want to
use, and create a new or use an existing MySQL user account that ARSC
can use to connect to the MySQL server.

Let's assume the name of the database is 'arsc', the username is
'arsc', and the password is 'somethingreallysecret' (please do not
choose this as your password!), and the MySQL server runs on the same
machine as your webserver, thus ARSC will connect to 'localhost'.

Of course you can name your database however you want, same goes for
the username and the password, and it is no problem if MySQL runs on
another machine.

Extract the zipped ARSC archive, and find the file 'config.inc.php'. It
is located in the directory 'inc', which is a subdirectory of 'base'
in the root directory of the extracted archive. Open this file in your
favorite text editor, and edit these four parameters:

define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_HOST", "localhost");
define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_USER", "user");
define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_PASSWORD", "password");
define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_DATABASE", "database");

Change them according to your installation. With our example values the
result would be:

define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_HOST", "localhost");
define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_USER", "arsc");
define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_PASSWORD", "somethingreallysecret");
define("ARSC_PARAMETER_DB_DATABASE", "arsc");

Now save your changes.

Then open up a FTP or SCP program, and copy all files you extracted
from the zipped archive onto your server.

Now start your favourite browser, and point it at the 'install'
directory. It is located in the directory 'inc', which is a
subdirectory of 'base' in the root directory of the extracted archive.
If for example your domain name is 'www.example.com', and you copied
all your files into a directory named 'chat', you would have to open
this url:

http://www.example.com/chat/base/install/

This script will do the necessary steps to finish the installation of
ARSC. If an error occurs, it will point you at the right direction to
get help. Please don't forget to write down the user accounts it will
list, and make sure you delete the 'install' directory once the
installation is finished, or other people can MESS UP YOUR INSTALLATION
and CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS!

You can then visit your chat at this url (example domain only):

http://www.example.com/chat/

And you can open the admin interface at this url (example domain only):

http://www.example.com/chat/base/admin/
