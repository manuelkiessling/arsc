ARSC Installation Instructions

Ok, quick and dirty, here is the deal: Copy the files onto the server,
change 'base/inc/config.inc.php' to fit your needs. Then get the content
of 'base/install/install.sql' and import it into your database. Afterwards,
take a look at the table 'arsc_parameters'. Change all the fields that
contain "www.example.com" to fit your server layout.

Then pray. Then it should work.

!!! PLEASE NOTE: The 'base/admin/' directory is not protected in any
way! You have to protect it yourself with .htaccess or other measures!
