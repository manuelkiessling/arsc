Due to the fact that my native language is not english, it is possible
or better very probably that there are several mistakes - I hope they
are at least funny... if you find one, then please send me an eMail to
manuel@kiessling.net. Thank you very much!

Ok, quick and dirty, here is the deal: Copy the files onto the server,
change 'base/inc/config.inc.php' to fit your needs. Then get the content
of 'base/install/install.sql' and import it into your database. Afterwards,
take a look at the table 'arsc_parameters'. Change all the fields that
contain "www.example.com" stuff to fit your server layout.
Then pray. Then it should work.
