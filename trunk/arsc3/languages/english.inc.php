General Help:
In the right frame you see all users
who are currently in the room.

Users with an @ in front of their name
are operators and can kick users out of
the room, give operator status to other
users, and take away their operator status.

If you click on a name on the right, the input
field will be filled with the command that is
neccessary to send a private message to this user.
You only have to append your message to the end
of the command line.

General Commands:
/me message -- Symbolizes an action, e.g. /me feels fine writes * User feels fine
/msg user message -- Sends a private message to an user
/j AnotherRoom -- Leaves the current room and enters room 'AnotherRoom'
/room room -- An alias to /j";

$arsc_lang["helpop"]        = "
Operator Commands:
/msgops message -- Whispers a message to all operators
/whois user -- Shows information about user
/op user -- Gives operator status to user
/deop user -- Takes operator status from user
/kick user -- Kicks user out of the chat
/bann user X -- Blocks IP of user for X seconds
/lock user -- Lock account of (registered!) user permanently
/rip user -- What user says is not shown
/unrip user -- What user says is shown again
/move user room -- Moves user into room";
